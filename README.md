# Reddit Sentiment Analysis Stock Picker

WIP

The goal of this project is to scrape reddit posts from WallStreetBets or other stock subreddits and invest based on the sentiment associated with each stock. Currently I am using NLTK's sentiment intensity analyzer but I am working on making my own model as it does not recognize words like "YOLO" and "moon" as positive or words like "cooked" as negative.
